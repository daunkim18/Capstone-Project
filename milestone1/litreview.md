## Literature Review

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized dental caries diagnosis by improving accuracy and efficiency through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Traditional methods like visual-tactile examination and radiographic imaging often struggle with early detection and subjectivity, leading to diagnostic inconsistencies (Selwitz et al., 2007). AI-driven approaches, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), have shown superior accuracy in analyzing dental images, identifying caries with over 90% precision (Yamashita et al., 2018). AI-powered tools such as AssistDent and YOLOv3-based object detection models have further improved real-time detection, reducing false positives and increasing diagnostic efficiency (Ding et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data privacy concerns, model bias, and clinician acceptance remain critical obstacles to widespread adoption (Rischke et al., 2022). Future advancements in federated learning, tele-dentistry integration, and explainable AI (XAI) are expected to refine AI-driven diagnostics, making them more accessible and reliable for dental professionals.

Fear of visiting the dentist is a common issue, especially among children and elderly patients. The intimidating dental environment, filled with complex equipment, bright lights, and sharp instruments, can discourage individuals from seeking timely dental care. Additionally, conventional dental examinations require healthcare professionals to manually inspect each tooth, which is time-consuming, can cause discomfort, and may lead to missed early signs of decay. Current diagnostic tools such as X-rays, including Orthopantomograms (OPG) and bitewing X-rays, offer effective imaging solutions but come with drawbacks. They require scheduled appointments, can be costly, and may not always be covered by insurance. These limitations highlight the need for an alternative solution that enhances efficiency, improves patient comfort, and reduces diagnostic errors. This project aims to introduce AI-powered imaging technology as a transformative approach to dental examinations. High-resolution images of the oral cavity, captured from multiple angles (occlusal, buccal, and lingual), will be analyzed using machine learning algorithms such as YOLO for object detection. This approach will allow accurate identification of cavities and early signs of decay without invasive procedures or traditional probing methods. 

The traditional dental examination process presents several challenges. Fear and anxiety, particularly among children and elderly patients, discourage dental visits and lead to neglected oral hygiene. Manual inspection of teeth is time-consuming and may result in diagnostic errors or missed cavities. X-rays, while effective, require scheduled appointments, involve radiation exposure, and can be costly if not covered by insurance. Dental hospitals must maintain a large inventory of sterilization equipment, increasing overhead costs and complexity in infection control. A more efficient, accurate, and patient-friendly solution is needed to improve dental examination procedures.  

Recent advancements in AI-driven dental imaging have demonstrated promising results in improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. AbuSalim et al. (2024) introduced a multi-granularity approach using YOLO-based object detection models for effective tooth detection and classification. Their findings suggest that AI-powered imaging can significantly enhance diagnostic precision, reducing errors associated with manual inspections. Furthermore, Ramírez-Pedraza et al. (2025) explored deep learning applications in oral hygiene, specifically focusing on automated dental plaque detection using the YOLO framework. Their study highlights the potential of AI models in improving preventive dental care by offering real-time detection and quantification of dental plaque using the O’Leary Index. These advancements indicate a growing trend toward AI integration in dentistry, paving the way for innovative solutions that minimize patient discomfort while optimizing clinical workflows. 

This project proposes the development and implementation of an AI-driven imaging system to modernize dental diagnostics. The specific objectives are to improve accuracy by utilizing machine learning-based object detection to enhance early cavity detection and reduce missed diagnoses. It aims to reduce costs by providing a cost-effective alternative to traditional X-rays, minimizing the need for expensive imaging equipment and additional fees. The project seeks to enhance the patient experience by offering a non-invasive, stress-free examination method, especially for patients with dental anxiety. Additionally, it ensures ethical and safe practices by reducing reliance on radiation-based diagnostics and minimizing discomfort through advanced imaging technology. Finally, it simplifies dental clinic operations by decreasing the need for excessive sterilization equipment, making the workflow more efficient and reducing hospital overhead costs. 

AbuSalim et al. (2024) explore the application of YOLO-based object detection models for dental image analysis, specifically focusing on tooth detection and classification. The study addresses the limitations of traditional dental imaging techniques and evaluates the effectiveness of AI-driven solutions. The researchers investigate whether YOLO-based object detection can enhance tooth classification accuracy compared to conventional methods. Their methodology involves training a YOLOv5 model on clinically sourced dental images, preprocessing the data, and evaluating model performance using standard accuracy metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP). The findings indicate that AI-based object detection significantly improves diagnostic accuracy, reducing errors commonly associated with manual inspections. The study demonstrates that YOLO models can efficiently identify multiple teeth with high precision, highlighting the potential for real-time AI-assisted dental analysis. However, the research also notes certain limitations, such as the relatively small dataset size, which may affect generalizability, and the dependency on high-quality image preprocessing for optimal performance. The study contributes to the field by demonstrating the feasibility of AI-powered dental diagnostics and emphasizing the importance of dataset quality in model training. This research is highly relevant to the current project, as it provides a strong foundation for leveraging YOLO-based models in dental imaging. Building on these findings, our study will extend this work by utilizing YOLOv8, incorporating a more diverse dataset, and refining detection accuracy and efficiency for practical clinical applications.
