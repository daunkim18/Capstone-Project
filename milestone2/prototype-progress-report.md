# Progress Report (03/19/2025)
## Overview
This milestone focuses on the continued development of our project, including environment setup, project realization, research paper outline, diagrams, issue tracking, and presentation.

We have made significant progress, including identifying image clarity issues, implementing data augmentation techniques, graphing results, planning additional milestone steps, adding a license, debugging and processing augmentation code, and resizing images. Our team has worked collaboratively to refine the dataset, ensuring consistency and clarity for future machine learning applications.

## Outcomes
* Identified image clarity issues: Evaluated the dataset and noted inconsistencies.

* Implemented data augmentation techniques: Applied various augmentation methods to improve image quality and diversity.

* Resized images: Standardized image sizes for consistency.

* Graphing methods: Visualized data through charts and graphs to analyze augmentation effects.

* Debugged and processed augmentation code: Worked collaboratively to resolve issues in data processing scripts.

* Added a project license: Ensured proper documentation and licensing compliance.

* Planned additional steps for Milestone 2: Defined upcoming tasks and

## Hinderances
* Some augmentation techniques introduced distortions that required further refinement.

* Debugging the image processing code took longer than expected.

* Some team members faced minor access issues with repository permissions.

## Ongoing Risks
| Risk | Status | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| Image clarity loss due to augmentation | Ongoing | Adjust augmentation parameters and test different techniques |
| Data processing bugs | Mitigated | Regular debugging sessions and peer reviews |
| Repository access issues | Addressed | Ensured all members have required permissions |
