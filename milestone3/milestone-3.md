# Progress Report (April 10, 2025)
## Overview
Since Milestone 2, we completed additional model evaluations, finalized the data preparation pipeline, and packaged the YOLOv8 object detection solution for deployment in dental diagnostics. Our focus was on polishing the model, validating results, and preparing the final report and documentation.

## Outcomes
* Improved YOLOv8 model accuracy through hyperparameter tuning.
* Packaged model and supporting files into a reproducible GitHub repository.
* Added markdown documentation for setup, usage, and evaluation.
* Created final report with comprehensive project summary and installation instructions.
* Completed video demo and presentation slides for final delivery.


## Hinderances
* Limited number of labeled images reduced training variety.
* Some false positives remained in object detection; further training with augmented data needed.
* Balancing precision vs. recall in binary classification was challenging due to small validation set.
